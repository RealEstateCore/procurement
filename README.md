# Official documents for procurement process

This repository contains documents to be used in procurement processes in several languages.



The purpose of this document is to be able to set requirements for compatibility with RealEstateCore (REC) in procurement and the implementation of various technical property systems, both in new production and in conversions of existing properties to be able to ensure that data from the systems can be accessed to other IT systems and that it is possible to control the systems and thus the property via external applications. Technical property systems refer to superior control systems (SCADA, BMS - Building Management System, BAS - Building Automation System) that control substations  (PLC) and / or fieldbus-based systems (Modbus, BACnet) and IoT systems (mqtt , https). This document continues to use the terms BMS, PLC, IoT system and external IT system as part of a technical property system.

This document does not prescribe:
* How to select or configure PLC
* Which fieldbuses to use
* Which BMS to select
* Which systems for elevators, passage or IoT to select.
* How to mark components on drawings or in BMS and PLC.
 
This document is primarily aimed at subcontractors such as technical consultants, system suppliers, property managers, project developers, purchasers, project managers and installation consultants.
